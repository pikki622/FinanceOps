# Functions for diversifying an investment portfolio.
#
# The main idea is to calculate a so-called "Full Exposure" of each
# asset, which takes into account the asset's correlation with other
# assets in the portfolio. We then want to find new asset-weights whose
# Full Exposure is equal to the originally desired asset-weights.
#
# For example, if we want Asset A to have weight 0.1 and Asset B to have
# weight 0.2 in the portfolio, but the two assets are also correlated
# with a factor 0.5, then we have a Full Exposure for each asset that
# is higher than their weights. A simple way of calculating the Full
# Exposure of Asset A is its weight 0.1 plus the correlation of 0.5
# multiplied with Asset B's weight of 0.2, so the Full Exposure of
# Asset A is 0.1 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.2, and likewise the Full Exposure
# of Asset B is 0.2 + 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.25. We then want to find new asset-
# weights so that the Full Exposure of Asset A is equal to the original
# desired weight of only 0.1, and the Full Exposure of Asset B is equal
# to its original desired weight of only 0.2.
#
# Note that the calculation of the Full Exposure is more sophisticated
# than in the example above, because it needs to satisfy several other
# requirements, as described in the paper referenced further below.
#
# We provide two methods here for finding the new asset-weights:
#
# - `optimize_weights` which tries to find new asset-weights that
#   minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the original asset-
#   weights and the Full Exposure of the new weights. This uses a
#   common optimization method such as L-BFGS-B, which works for small
#   portfolios but is extremely slow for large portfolios.
#
# - `adjust_weights` is a custom-made algorithm for this problem,
#   which is both much faster and is also capable of finding much more
#   precise asset-weights that give a much lower MSE between the
#   original asset-weights and the Full Exposure of the new weights.
#
# All this is explained in more detail in the following paper:
# - M.E.H. Pedersen, "Simple Portfolio Optimization That Works!", 2021.

    Calculate the so-called "Full Exposure" for each asset, which measures
    the entire portfolio's exposure to each asset both directly through the
    asset weights themselves, but also indirectly through their correlations
    with other assets in the portfolio.

    There are different ways of defining the Full Exposure, as explained in
    the paper referenced above. This particular formula is Eq.(38) in the
    paper referenced above, which was found to work well in practice.

    The function is decorated with Numba Jit, which means it compiles into
    super-fast machine-code the first time it is run. This function is the most
    expensive part of the diversification method because it has time-complexity
    O(n^2) where n is the number of assets in the portfolio. Implementing it
    with for-loops instead of Numpy arrays, means that it avoids new memory
    allocations for large n^2 matrices, so the machine-code is very fast.

    For large portfolios of e.g. 1000 assets or more, this can run even faster
    by using `@jit(parallel=True)` as the function decorator. But for smaller
    portfolios of only e.g. 100 assets, the parallelization overhead makes it
    run a bit slower, so you have to turn on the parallelism manually.

    Note that the arguments must be Python lists or Numpy arrays and cannot be
    Pandas Series and DataFrames, because Numba Jit does not support Pandas.

    Find new asset-weights that minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between
    the original asset-weights and the Full Exposure of the new asset-weights.

    This uses a custom algorithm for this particular problem. It is much faster
    than the `optimize_weights` function, especially for very large portfolios.

    For a portfolio of 1000 assets it only takes 20 milli-seconds to run this,
    depending on the CPU, arguments, and the weights and correlation matrix.
    Removing some of the options and overhead in the function can significantly
    improve the speed. But Numba Jit cannot improve the speed of this function.

    :param weights_org:
        Array with the originally desired asset-weights for the portfolio.
        These can be either positive or negative and they need not sum to 1.
        This data can either be a Pandas Series or Numpy array.

    :param corr:
        Matrix with the correlations between assets. These are assumed to be
        between -1 and 1. This can either be a Pandas DataFrame or Numpy array.

        Array with a better starting guess for the adjusted asset-weights.
        If you are calling this function with `weights_org` and `corr` being
        nearly identical on each call, then you might save computation time
        by passing the last weights that were output from this function as
        the arg `weights_guess` the next time you call this function. This
        may reduce the number of iterations needed for convergence.

    :param fillna:
        Boolean whether to fill NaN-values (Not-a-Number) in `weights_org`
        and `corr` with 0.0, and fill the diagonal of `corr` with 1.0 values.

    :param log:
        If this is a list-like object then it will have its function `append`
        called after each iteration with the new weights, so you can print
        them later. This is useful for debugging and other demonstrations.

    :param variant:
        String for the algorithm variant used to update the portfolio weights:
        - 'vec' is for vectorized update of all weights simultaneously.
        - 'elm' is for element-wise update of all the weights.
        - 'inv' is for using the mathematical inverse to update the weights.

    :param step_size:
        Float between 0.0 and 1.0 for the convergence speed of the algorithm.
        Values closer to 0.0 are slower and values closer to 1.0 are faster.
        There does not appear to be any difference in the results obtained,
        so you might as well leave this to its default value of 1.0.

    :param max_iter:
        Max iterations of the algorithm.
